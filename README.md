# Personal Portfolio (React + TypeScript + Vite)

Static, deployable portfolio with multiple pages: Home, Projects, Gallery, Achievements, Blog, Contact.

## Features
- Home page with intro, GitHub-driven Skills/Languages, and a Download CV button (replace `public/cv/Nipuni_Gurusinghe_CV.pdf`).
- Projects page automatically lists public repos from GitHub (`nipuni-Gurusinghe`).
- Gallery page with simple cards (replace images in `public/assets/gallery`).
- Achievements page loads from `data/achievements.json` (due to LinkedIn API limitations) and links to LinkedIn profile.
